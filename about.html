        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Hello, my name is Amy Tu. I am currently a student at the University of Oklahoma.
            I am currently majoring in Management Information Systems and minoring in Accounting. As a student at the Univeristy of Oklahoma,
            I am passionate about the things I set my mind to and make the effort to overcome challenges that come my way. I am someone who is openminded and
            enjoy hearing people and their perspectives. I believe that there are always two sides to a story, and in order to complete a story, you must hear
            all sides and understand where people are coming from.
