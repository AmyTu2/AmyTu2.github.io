            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Hello, my name is Amy Tu. I am currently a student at the University of Oklahoma.
                I am currently majoring in Management Information Systems and minoring in Accounting. As a student at the Univeristy of Oklahoma,
                I am passionate about the things I set my mind to and make the effort to overcome challenges that come my way. I am someone who is openminded and
                enjoy hearing people and their perspectives. I believe that there are always two sides to a story, and in order to complete a story, you must hear
                all sides and understand where people are coming from.
