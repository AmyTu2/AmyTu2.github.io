        <h3>Databases Project</h3>
            <p><i>Spring 2019</i></p>
            <p class="text">This project is a database project that I worked on within a group of 5 people, where we created a database for a company, Sonner Tire.
            We came together as a group to discuss and fix problems with our database as they arose. We dealt closely with overcoming challenges through SQL
            and problem-sovling our queries. Over the semester, we as a gorup have come across obstacles, such as delegation, communication, and time management.
            However, as a group, we were able to overcome these obstacles together by working closely with one another and communicating when problems arose.</p>
